// You are planning a road trip (in a time before Google Maps) and want to know how long each
//  segment of the trip is going to be. Given an array of objects like this:
// {
//     name: `Jake's Great Shakes`,
//     speedLimits: [
//         {
//             distance: 100,
//             speedLimit: 75
//         },
//         {
//             distance: 84,
//             speedLimit: 70
//         },
//         {
//             distance: 20,
//             speedLimit: 75
//         }
//     ],
//     traffic: 30
// }
// Update the given function so that the segmentTimes array in the result object contains
// the times for each segment of the trip in hours. You can round the times to whole numbers. 
// Also update the totalTime property to be the total time of the trip.
// Additionally, because you like data, you want to know what the average speed limit for each 
//segment of the trip of is.
// Since you are traveling different distances at each speed, youâ€™ll need to weight the averages. 
//For example, given a trip segment where you travel 10 miles at 50 MPH and for 20 miles at 35 MPH, 
//the average weighted speed limit would be 39.9. If you just added 50 and 35 and divided by 2 for a 
//typical average, you would get 42.5. The weighted average is lower since you traveled a longer
// distance at the lower speed.
// As you find these weighted averages, add them into the avgSpeedLimits array in the result object.
// Return the result object from the function.
// Hint: You can use the reduce method.
